# Quantitative RNAseq

RNAseq is a technology which ultilises the next generation sequencing (NGS) to sequence the RNA molecules in a biological system. The technique was developed more than a decade ago, and has became ubiquitous in genetic research. With the help of RNAseq, we can answer the central question: *which gene is differentially expressed?*, referred as differencial gene expression (DGE). With technical advancements, new applications of RNAseq including studying translation (translatome), RNA structure (structurome), spatial transciptomics (spatialomics) and so on.
